# Program Pre-Work

Welcome! Congratulations on your acceptance to GreyAtom's Data Science Program. We hope you are really excited!! We want you to get ready for the program and have a smooth experience.

In this module we will take you through all the steps that you should complete before you attend first classroom session of the program.

## Overview

This guide covers the following steps that you need to go through to prepare for the class. Review and complete all the steps. Some people may find some tasks very challenging, but go slowly through all of them and you shall be easily able to do it.

 * Pre-readings
   * Overview of Linear algebra
   * Overview of Statistics
   * Overview of Python
   * Overview of Machine Learning
 * Setting up your local system
   * Setting up your operating system
   * Install python using Anaconda
   * Setting up the version control system

 

 Having trained more than 700+ professionals into various aspects of data science, our first hand experience says that people who were able to complete pre-readings before coming to the classroom had very different outcomes versus people who didâ€™nt.


# Pre-Reading Material
Here are few resources that help you stand out from the rest. We strongly recommend everyone to go through the mentioned material before coming to the class. For many these would be just revisiting the concepts learned earlier, while for some they would be completely new concepts. We would like to **re-emphasize** that learners who are visiting these concepts for the first time should dedicate extra time to pre work and get thorough with it.

### Beginners Level
This is for the learners from a non math and statistics background, or learn who need a refresher on basic topics

#### Linear Algebra
* [Basic Linear Algebra for Machine Learning (Estimated time : 4 hours)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/comprehensive-guide-to-linear-algebra/)

#### Statistics
* [Statistics & Probability (Estimated time :10 Hours | Tip - watch the videos on 1.5x speed)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) 


### Intermediate Level
If you are well versed with the basics of linear algebra and statistics you can skip the beginners level content and focus on these topics. Learners who have completed the beginners level can proceed with this content.
#### Linear Algebra
* [Intermediate topics in Linear Algebra for Machine Learning (Estimated time : 10 hours)](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html)
#### Statistics

## Blogs to Follow

We will share many more, when in the course, but here are some very good starting points

* [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)
* [KDnuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/)


# Setting up your local system

## Setting up your operating system

 * Minimum system requirements for the laptop to be used during the course - 64 bit system, minimum 4 GB RAM (8GB preferred), i3 and above processor.

 * You can use either Windows/ Mac OS/ Ubuntu 16.04 while working through the program. However, we **strongly recommend** you to use Ubuntu / Mac OS.

#### Mac OS

 We'll be using `Homebrew` to install and manage packages.

 * [Install `xcode` using this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/211541/homebrew-for-os-x-easily-installs-desktop-apps-and-terminal-utilities/)
 * [Install `brew` using this guide](https://brew.sh/)

#### Ubuntu 16.04 or higher

 You are already using Ubuntu? Just make sure you are using 16.04 LTS or higher and you are all set.

 In case you are new to Ubuntu, [here is a guide](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-16-04-lts) to get started. Installation related help available on [Ubuntu Forums](https://ubuntuforums.org/) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

#### Windows

 You can use any given Windows version: Win7, Win8/8.1 or Win10.

  * If you are on Windows and want to run Ubuntu you can create a dual boot system. [Here](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/) is a beginners guide for the same.
  * Using VMWare to run Ubuntu 16.04 from inside of Windows is **not recommended**

## Install Python using Anaconda
Anaconda distribution is the easiest way to install Python along with most popular machine learning libraries that you will be needing for the program. You can download Anaconda 3.6 or higher for you operating system from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Follow [this](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)
step by step guide to install the same.

## Setting up Version Controlling System (Git and GitHub)

 * Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
 * [Hands on Introduction to using Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD), video series (27 minutes)

 Two companion blog posts:
